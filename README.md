# ARPpoisoning_IPspoofing_ESP8266
This repo describes how to perform ARP poisoning and UDP packet forgering on ESP8266 communication

The .pdf file describes in details the project and shows the results <br /> <br />

The .py files are used to perform the attacks <br />
&emsp; ARP_poisoning.py is the pyhton script that performs ARP poisoning<br />
&emsp; send_ip_packet.py is the python script that performs UDP packet forgering <br /> <br />


The .ino files are used to configure both ESP8266's: <br />
&emsp; listening_esp.ino is used to configure the listening ESP8266 <br />
&emsp; sending_esp.ino is used to configure the sending ESP8266 <br /> <br />


The file .pcap is a wireshark capture of the communication between both ESP8266's while perofrming attacks.
